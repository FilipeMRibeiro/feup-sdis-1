## Purpose of the Application

The group proposes to develop a cross-platform collaborative drawing application.

The application will have *two main screens*: a *main menu* screen and a *room* screen.  
In the **main menu**, users will be able to *join* existing rooms, or to *create* new rooms.
After having joined or created a room, users are presented with the **room screen**. Each room has a *canvas* where its users will be able to draw, sketch, or paint collaboratively with each other. The canvas of each room is unique, and therefore what is drawn in the canvas of a room, is not drawn on any other canvas of other rooms.


## Main Features

When users start the app they are presented with a *menu* containing three buttons. Each button *deploys* one of the following *actions*:

#### **Join** a *public* room
- **Join** a *private* room
- **Create** a *new* room

- Create rooms
- Join rooms
- Sketch/draw


## Target Platforms

- Java standalone application for PC/Mac
- Application for mobile devices:
  - Android


## Additional Services and Improvements

### Authentication

### Fault tolerance

### Consistency

### Scalability


## Proposed grade ceiling

Given the described features, and application architecture, the group considers 20 to be a valid ceiling for the final grade.
